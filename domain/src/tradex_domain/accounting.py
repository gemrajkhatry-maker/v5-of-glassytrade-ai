"""Shared position accounting — the single weighted-average + realized-PnL model.

Every execution mode books positions and realized P&L through exactly the same
math here: the reactive pipeline (``PositionManager``), the backtester
(``BacktestEngine``), the paper broker, and corporate-action adjustments
(``apply_split`` / ``apply_dividend``) — so there is no duplicated accounting
logic that could diverge between backtest, replay, paper, and live (parity
review CRITICAL-1; corporate actions modeled consistently, review area #4).

Living in :mod:`tradex_domain` makes the model importable from the broker
layer (domain <- brokers is the allowed dependency direction), so the paper
broker can reuse it instead of re-implementing weighted-average accounting.

Pure Decimal math, no I/O. The caller owns persistence (cache / local dict).

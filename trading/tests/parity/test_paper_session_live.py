"""Live parity test — the paper and backtest session paths end-to-end.

Proves the documented execution-mode flow with no mocks and no internals.
Paper path:

    TradingSession.paper() → ReactiveStrategyEngine.register(discovered strategy)
        → bus.publish(Candle) → Signal → PlaceOrderCommand
        → ExecutionEngine (PaperFillSource) → OrderPlaced + OrderFilled
        → OMS cache + PositionManager

Backtest path (mode parity through the composition root):

    boot(AppConfig(mode="backtest")) → same flow via SimulatedFillSource
        → OMS cache + PositionManager

Every order-producing path asserts the exact documented CQRS event spine
on the bus — PlaceOrderCommand → OrderPlaced → OrderFilled. ReactiveBus
publishes causally (nested publishes are drained before publish returns), so
the raw stream order matches the message log; boot's shared bus interleaves
collateral orders from both discovered strategies on the same instrument, so
its assertions stay scoped by tag/instrument.

Everything is driven and asserted through the documented public surface:
``TradingSession.paper()``, ``session.bus``, ``session.stream.subscribe_fills()``,
``session.engine.cache``, ``session.trade.get_order()`` / ``get_orderbook()``,
``session.portfolio.positions()``, and ``session.stop()``.

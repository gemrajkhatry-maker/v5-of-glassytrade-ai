"""MarketFeed — bridge live broker WebSocket ticks into the reactive bus.

The live brokers expose ``subscribe_quotes`` (both) plus either
``subscribe_depth`` (Dhan's dedicated depth-20 backend) or
``subscribe_depth_30`` (Upstox 30-level mode). This bridge subscribes both
streams for a set of instruments and publishes every received ``Quote`` /
``Depth`` onto the session reactive bus, where ``StreamService`` consumers and
the FastAPI ``/ws/stream`` bridge pick them up.

Wired by ``TradingSession.live()``; paper sessions have no live feed.

Design
------
* ``MarketFeed`` keeps a single broker handler per stream type and a wanted
  instrument set; the handlers publish only ticks for wanted instruments.
  Instruments can be added (``subscribe``) or removed (``unsubscribe``) on the
  fly; depth can be toggled per ``subscribe`` call. ``start`` is a reset
  (stop + subscribe).  * ``FeedRegistry`` refcounts instrument subscriptions across multiple
    WebSocket clients sharing the session feed, so one client unsubscribing
    never drops a stream another client still holds. ``acquire``/``release``
    track client connections; teardown is owned by the refcounts and
    ``session.stop()``, never by a client release.
* Streaming capabilities come from the broker's ``BrokerCapabilities`` table
  (``depth_levels``, ``max_stream_instruments``): the feed advertises them
  and enforces the per-connection instrument cap loudly (``ValueError``)
  instead of sending more keys than the broker accepts.

Notes
-----
* Ticks arrive on each backend's daemon receive thread and are published
  straight into the bus — the same accepted cross-thread parity as the
  execution engine publishing ``OrderFilled`` from worker threads.
* Socket drops are healed by the broker backends themselves
  (``AutoReconnectMixin`` — reopen with a fresh token, replay the live
  subscription set, exponential backoff), not by the feed.
* ``stop()`` unsubscribes the broker handlers; the underlying WebSocket
  sockets are owned by the broker and torn down by ``broker.close()``
  (e.g. ``RuntimeContext.close``), not by the feed or session.

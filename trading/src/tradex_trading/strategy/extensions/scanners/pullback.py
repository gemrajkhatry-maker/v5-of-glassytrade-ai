"""Example extension scanner — two-condition pullback screen (reference material).

Ships with the framework to exercise the extensions auto-discovery mechanism
harder than the momentum screen: this definition combines **two** conditions
(a price filter *and* an RSI indicator filter) so ``ScannerEngine._evaluate``
scores against both and the scanner only surfaces instruments that clear
both — rank by score, so a 2/2 hit outranks a 1/2 hit.

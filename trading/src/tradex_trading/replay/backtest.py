                engine advances it to each event's timestamp during ``run()``
                so ``clock.now()`` reflects the simulated instant.
            fee_calculator: Optional FeeCalculator; when provided, fees are
                deducted from cash on each fill and surfaced in BacktestResult.
            slippage_model: Optional slippage model; when provided, the fill
                price is worsened by the model on each trade (BUY pays more,
                SELL receives less). Defaults to no slippage.
            corporate_actions: Optional ``CorporateActionStore``; when
                provided, SPLIT/BONUS/DIVIDEND actions whose ex-date falls on
                or before a fill bar are applied to the open position at that
                point — point-in-time, once each, through the same shared
                accounting math as ``PositionManager`` (parity review area
                #4: corporate actions modeled consistently across modes).

        Note: fees are charged on the *applied* fill — a SELL larger than the
        open position is capped at the position, so the fee matches the
        actual (capped) quantity, and a SELL with no position to close pays
        no fee.

        risk_manager:
            Optional shared ``RiskManager`` (the same class the reactive
            ``ExecutionEngine`` uses). When provided, each signal's order is
            risk-checked at the fill candle's open — the same request the
            ``next_open`` reactive bridge submits — and a rejected order is
            skipped entirely (no fill, no P&L), mirroring OrderRejected in
            paper/live (parity review area #1/#4: risk decisions consistent
            across modes). ``max_position_value`` binds to the backtest's own
            open positions when the manager has no explicit provider; the
            orders-per-minute window is evaluated at the fill timestamp for
            determinism. Defaults to None (no risk gate — historical behavior).

            Dedicate the manager to this engine: ``run()`` binds its
            positions provider and resets its rate window, so concurrent
            runs sharing one manager would race on the provider binding, and
            its rate-limit state belongs to the backtest, not live order flow.
